Once upon a time in a land of zeros and ones, there was a humble developer named Sam who lived in the mystical kingdom of Stack Overflow. Sam’s greatest passion was coding, and his biggest fear was... The Infinite Loop. 

One day, the King summoned Sam to the royal palace. "Sam," the King said gravely, "our kingdom's economy has plummeted because our Shopping Cart system keeps charging customers twice. No one is shopping anymore. Fix it, or else!"

Sam, sweating nervously, promised to fix the bug. He cracked his knuckles and dove into the kingdom's archaic codebase, a sprawling labyrinth of spaghetti code. Just when he thought he found the bug, he ran into an error that read: *"You shall not pass."*

Determined, Sam copied the error message and sought help from the kingdom's wise sages—the people of Stack Overflow. "Please," he begged, "someone help me understand what this means."

One sage answered, "Ah, young coder, that's a 500 error. It means something mysterious happened on the server side. The last time I saw this, the backend developer disappeared without a trace."

Sam gulped. But he pressed on, tweaking variables, adding print statements, and even, in a desperate moment, refreshing the page 27 times. Finally, he thought he fixed it and triumphantly pushed the update. Little did he know, a rogue `for` loop nested inside another loop was still lingering in the code, causing the system to multiply each item in the cart.

A royal shopper soon tested it, adding an apple to the cart. But when they clicked "checkout," the cart showed 128 apples. "Ah, a glitch!" the shopper thought, refreshing the page... But each refresh only doubled the number of apples, until there were more apples than in the entire kingdom's orchards.

The King summoned Sam back to the palace, red-faced and holding a cart filled with 65,536 apples. "Explain this," he demanded.

Sam nervously chuckled, “Well, technically, it’s a *feature*—one that encourages bulk buying."

The King wasn’t amused. But as he pondered his next move, the kingdom's residents, fascinated by this strange bug, began flocking to the site just to see how many apples they could add to their carts before the page crashed. A week later, Sam's ‘feature’ had gone viral, and the kingdom's economy bounced back, thriving on the curiosity of the internet.

And so, Sam was celebrated as a hero. From that day on, he always triple-checked his loops. And the kingdom, now famous for its “infinite shopping cart challenge,” lived debugged and happily ever after.

The end.
